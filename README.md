Clustering using Fuzzy Logic 

### **Fuzzy Logic**
Fuzzy logic is an extension of classical logic in which values can be either a 0 or 1 whereas in fuzzy logic the value can be any real number between 0 and 1 both inclusive. Fuzzy Logic is an Extension of classical logic. It deals with vagueness which occur in cases where boundary is not clear, when we cannot quantify the value as completely true and completely false or when there is some sort of an uncertainty involved which occur quite often in physical experiments. Fuzzy logic is a principal component of Soft computing which deals with approximate models, uncertainty, imprecision, partial truth and approximations and gives solutions to complex real-life problems.
